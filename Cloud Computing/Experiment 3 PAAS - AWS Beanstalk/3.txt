Aim: Write steps and Implement Platform as a service in AWS by deploying static/dynamic web application or web services.  Make sure instances should be terminated after successful implementation.

To implement Platform as a Service in AWS by deploying a web application or web services, you can follow these steps:

Create an AWS account and log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service from the console.
Click on the "Create New Application" button.
Provide a name and description for your application.
Select the platform for your application. For example, if you are deploying a Python web application, choose the Python platform.
Choose the type of environment for your application. For example, if you want a web server to host your web application, choose the Web Server environment.
Configure the environment settings, such as the instance type, key pair, and database settings.
Upload your web application code or web service code to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Start the deployment process by clicking the "Create Environment" button.
Wait for the deployment to complete. This may take several minutes or more, depending on the size and complexity of your application.
Test your application by navigating to the URL provided by the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Once you have confirmed that your application is working correctly, terminate the environment to avoid unnecessary charges.
