Here are the steps to implement Database as a Service in AWS using DynamoDB:

Login to your AWS console and navigate to the DynamoDB service.

Click on the “Create table” button.

Enter a name for your table, and set the primary key.

Choose the provisioned throughput capacity for your table. This determines the maximum number of read and write capacity units that your table can handle per second.

Click on the “Create” button.

Once the table is created, you can start adding items to it using the console or API.

To access the data stored in DynamoDB, you can use the AWS SDKs or APIs.

To terminate the instance after successful implementation, go to the DynamoDB console, select the table you created and click on the “Delete table” button.

Confirm the action by typing the table name in the box provided and click “Delete”.

Your DynamoDB table and any data stored in it will be permanently deleted.
