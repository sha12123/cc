Aim:Write steps amd implement in AWS alies user of your account and give some access write to the same. Make sure instances should be terminated after successful implementation.

Here are the steps to create an AWS IAM user and give them write access:

Log in to your AWS console and navigate to the IAM service.
Click on "Users" in the left-hand menu and then click on "Add user" button.
Provide a name for the user and check the box for "Programmatic access".
Click on "Next" and select the "Attach existing policies directly" option.
Search for the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy and select it.
Click on "Next" and review the user details.
Click on "Create user" to create the user.
Once the user is created, you will see their "Access key ID" and "Secret access key". Keep these credentials secure, as they are necessary to access AWS resources programmatically.
